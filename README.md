## How to contribute

Contributions are welcome! Here are all the ways you can contribute to the project.

### Pull Requests

To propose improvements or fix a bug, feel free to submit a PR.

### Pull request checklist

In order to ease code reviews and have your contributions merged faster, here is a list of items you can check before submitting a PR:

- Create small PRs that are narrowly focused on addressing a single concern.
- Write tests for the code you wrote.
- Open your PR against the master branch.
- Maintain clean commit history and use meaningful commit messages. PRs with messy commit history are difficult to review and require a lot of work to be merged.
- Your PR must pass all CI tests before we will merge it. If you're seeing an error and don't think it's your fault, it may not be! The reviewer will help you if there are test failures that seem not related to the change you are making.

## Build

To build the Arduino Tools VS Code extension (VSIX), execute:

```
yarn
```

It will generate a `vscode-arduino-tools-x.x.x.vsix` file in the `./build-artifacts` folder.
In VS Code, open the `Extensions` panel, click on the ellipses (`...`) and select `Install from VSIX...`.
Or from the [_Command Palette_](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_install-from-a-vsix).

You can also start the extension in debug mode.
Open the `Debug` panel, and select the `Launch Arduino Tools ‚Äì VS Code Extension` launch configuration.

## Deployments

To deploy a new release of the tools you have to do the following:

- update the `version` in the package.json file
- push a tag to the repo with `v` and the version you spacified in the package.json, for example `v0.0.2-beta.1`
